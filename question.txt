# 🧑‍🎓 **Project 2**
## Health Awareness Campaign Website  
### Case Study: *“Say No to Drug Abuse”*

---

### 📖 Scenario  
A youth NGO called **Hope for the Future** is worried about the rise of **drug abuse among teenagers**. They want to launch a **“Say No to Drugs” awareness campaign** to educate young people and inspire them to make better life choices.  

Since they cannot afford a big social media campaign, they decided to start with a **simple but powerful website** that communicates their message clearly.  

They’ve reached out to **your team** to design and build this awareness website using only **HTML + CSS**.

### 🎯 Goals of the Project  
The NGO’s website should:  
1. **Educate** visitors about the dangers of drug abuse.  
2. **Inspire** young people by giving them **positive alternatives**.  
3. **Engage** them with real quotes or testimonies.  
4. **Invite** visitors to take action (contact/join the movement).
